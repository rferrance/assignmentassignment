This assignment would give the students an overview of different *NIX enviroments, allowing them
to see the differences in versions of UNIX and Linux.  It would be assigned near the beginning of 
the semester, giving the students the chance to explore different options to use in class as well.
Since the intent is to assign it near the beginning of the year, it will just be assigned in a simple
text file, since we have will not have gone over markdown or makefiles at that time.

Since this would be a writing based assignment, most likely about a page single spaced, the points
would be given almost wholly for content, as long as it is legible grammar is not the focus.  I would
spread out the points so that each operating system review is ten points, two points for similarities
to the others, four for differences, and four for a good discription of the operating system.  If the
paper was decently shorter than the requirement up to five points would be duducted.
